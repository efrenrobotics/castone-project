## Problem Statement and Description

### Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a user-centric, dynamic recipe book that utilizes AI.

Sometimes while looking through the kitchen one gets stumped thinking about what to make with the ingredients they have. They spend more time thinking about eating than actually eating. Our app comes to mitigate that problem.

Target Audience : Emerging Adults

### Description

An AI powered chef that creates recipes based on ingredients and a cuisine chosen by YOU!
We want to aid emerging adults in the kitchen as it’s difficult to decide what to cook. So we have created and utilized this AI tool to help those looking to cook and diversify their palates!
