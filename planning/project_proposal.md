# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Blessing Adomakoh, Faaizah Afoda, Efren Mendoza Enriquez

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

The challenge is to develop a user-centric, dynamic recipe book that utilizes AI.

Sometimes while looking through the kitchen one gets stumped thinking about what to make with the ingredients they have. They spend more time thinking about eating than actually eating. Our app comes to mitigate that problem. 

 
Target Audience : Emerging Adults 

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

An AI powered chef that creates recipes based on ingredients and a cuisine chosen by YOU!
We want to aid emerging adults in the kitchen as it’s difficult to decide what to cook. So we have created and utilized this AI tool to help those looking to cook and diversify their palates! 

## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups' brainstormed features list

### Core Features
  * Input form that stores ingredients into a list
    * ingredientsList = [”tomatoes”, “garlic”, “spaghetti”, “bacon”]
  * Make an OpenAI GPT API request
    * Prompt - “Make a recipe with the following ingredients” + ingredientsList
  * Display a recipe component and store recipe into user recipes table
  * User can navigate to past recipes
  * User authentication, register and login, to view the users recipes  
  * Create a recipe by ‘cuisine’ category

### Stretch Features
  * Friend Network
    * Add comments
    * feed with their created recipes
  * Include health and diet information
     * pull from a recipe book api
  * Map to show where food is from

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

There is an app called ChefGPT where users can input ingredients they have, and it acts as a kitchen assistant, providing them with a recipe. However, our app will be different in that we aim to include all communities and be as accessible as possible, so we will have the option for users to specify the type of cuisine they want (i.e. Nigerian food, Mexican food, Cajun food, etc.). 

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?


We want to know:
What are some potential roadblocks that we might face while doing this project and how can we avoid or overcome them?
Are there any concerns you may have about our project and our ability to execute?


Research:
We want to look into how to use Figma and Tailwind CSS to elevate our project. 
We will research how to make requests to the OpenAI API. 
User authentication and friend network and how to implement that
